--- Part Two ---

The Turing machine, and soon the entire computer, springs back to life. A console glows dimly nearby, awaiting your command.

> reboot printer
Error: That command requires priority 50. You currently have priority 0.
You must deposit 50 stars to increase your priority to the required level.

The console flickers for a moment, and then prints another message:

Star accepted.
You must deposit 49 stars to increase your priority to the required level.

The garbage collector winks at you, then continues sweeping.
